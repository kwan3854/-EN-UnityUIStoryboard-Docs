# Page and Modal

## Organizing concepts

The UI Storyboard organizes all UI into two UI elements.

* Page
* Modal

Learn about these two UI elements.

### Page

* The most basic component of the screen
* When the screen is toggled/moved, it means that this Page is toggled to another Page.
* All UI elements must exist within something called this Page.

### Modal

* A UI component that appears as a popup independent of the Page.
* It is displayed on top of all other UI elements, including game elements.
* Multiple Modals can be stacked on top of each other.
