# Manage code dependencies and .asmdefs

* Separate Model, View, Presenter, UseCase, Repository, and Gateway into separate .asmdefs
* Prevent unnecessary dependency transitions and clarify the boundaries between layers.
* Extract interfaces from View/Model only on demand for "really common" elements.
