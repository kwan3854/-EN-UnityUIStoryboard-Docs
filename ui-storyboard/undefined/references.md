The UI design philosophy is inspired by the implementations of CyberAgent and Mirrativ.
{% endhint %}

## 1. Inspired development approaches

* &#x20;CyberAgent/Cygames' UI development method [unityscreennavigator](../../unityscreennavigator/ "mention")
* &#x20;Mirrativ's Out-Game development approach [screensystem](../../screensystem/ "mention")

The UI structure, architecture, and team collaboration practices of these two examples are the foundation of our Unity UI system.
