The UI design philosophy was inspired by the implementations of CyberAgent and Mirrativ.

## 1\. the development approach you referenced

-  How CyberAgent/Cygames' UI is developed [unityscreennavigator](../../unityscreennavigator/ "mention")
-  Mirrativ's approach to out-game development [screensystem](../../screensystem/ "mention")

These two examples of UI structure and architecture, and how teams collaborate, have shaped the Unity UI system.
