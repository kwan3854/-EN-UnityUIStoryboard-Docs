# ScreenSystem

{% hint style="warning" %}
This document is written as a tribute to the original creators of ScreenSystem and as an introduction to various UI code design patterns. The code I write using UI Storyboard in Unity is based on blog posts by the developers of the library and may differ slightly from the patterns described in the UI Storyboard documentation.
{% endhint %}

This documentation is an organized documentation of the ScreenSystem library developed by Mirrativ.

This document is largely reorganized and analyzed from Mirrativ's technical blog, with additions/changes based on information gained from code analysis and usage.
