What is an # out game?

As game developers will be familiar with, games are divided into in-game and out-game. The in-game is the core of the game experience, where you control your character or have action. Outgame is often comprised of multiple screens and transitions, and includes features like character enhancements, draws, and shops. Its primary function is to manipulate UI such as buttons, communicate with the server, and switch between screens.
