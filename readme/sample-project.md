Unity UI Storyboard Sample Project


- A sample project that implements and applies the sample code described in this article.
- The UI assets used to demonstrate the artist's UI/UX design are, [available on the Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/gui-neon2-290592)and are not included in this sample project repository. (UI images may not display correctly, but the logic is still playable and demonstrable.)
- To explore the sample project, you can clone the repository in its entirety and run it in the Unity Editor.
